NAME
       hdparm - get/set SATA/IDE device parameters

SYNOPSIS
       hdparm [options] [device ...]

DESCRIPTION
       hdparm  provides a command line interface to various kernel interfaces supported by the Linux SATA/PATA/SAS "libata" subsystem and the older IDE driver subsystem.  Many newer (2008 and later)
       USB drive enclosures now also support "SAT" (SCSI-ATA Command Translation) and therefore may also work with hdparm.  E.g. recent WD "Passport" models and recent  NexStar-3  enclosures.   Some
       options may work correctly only with the latest kernels.

       -t     Perform timings of device reads for benchmark and comparison purposes.  For meaningful results, this operation should be repeated 2-3 times on an otherwise inactive  system  (no  other
              active  processes) with at least a couple of megabytes of free memory.  This displays the speed of reading through the buffer cache to the disk without any prior caching of data.  This
              measurement is an indication of how fast the drive can sustain sequential data reads under Linux, without any filesystem overhead.  To ensure accurate measurements, the buffer cache is
              flushed during the processing of -t using the BLKFLSBUF ioctl.

       -T     Perform  timings  of  cache  reads for benchmark and comparison purposes.  For meaningful results, this operation should be repeated 2-3 times on an otherwise inactive system (no other
              active processes) with at least a couple of megabytes of free memory.  This displays the speed of reading directly from the Linux buffer cache without disk access.  This measurement is
              essentially an indication of the throughput of the processor, cache, and memory of the system under test.

Here we have 2k\*5\*100 ~= 2MB per sample (high estimate), this means that it takes 0.25s
of IO per batch of 32 samples and ~1s per batch of 128 samples.  
We consider buffered disk reads instead of cached reads as the batchs are shuffled.

One epoch needs to see all the data, assumuning that we have 8TB of data per machine (one full
disk), one epoch should thus take 8.000.000 / 220 ~ 36363s ~ 10h.

Assuming 10-20 epochs for convergence that will bring us to 5d-10d for training a model (without
hyperparameter search) only considering IO costs.

[Deep Learning in Bioinformatics Seonwoo Min ,Byunghan Lee, and Sungroh Yoon](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.06430.pdf)

Overall deep learning in bioinformatics and computational biology is growing exponentially since the
early 2010's, this means that there are a lot of research activity even though it is quite recent.

The current most worked areas are protein-protein interractions and protein structures, as show the
two following reviews. We also looked at the publications in PLOS, ICML, Bioninformatics, NIPS, ICLR
and CVPR and confirmed the result of the review.

Variant callers (both small and structural) has not yet been hit by Deep Learning yet in a similar
fashion which leaves us with a great opportunity for innovation.

[DeepNANO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28582401) used RNNs for base calling in MinION
nanapore with great success (77.9% vs 71.3% on E. Coli base calling precision vs Metrichor).
This works because the tools used in claasical methods are HMM+Viterbi which is known to be well
replaced by RNNs (many successes in speach processing used Deep RNNs there).

## Definitions

This section contains the definitions of technical terms used in this report, please feel free to
refer back to them as you go through the report.

### Genetics

- *Ploidy* : number of sets of chromosomes in a cell.
- *Diploid* : organism with two sets of chromosomes, thus having two alleles that can be the same
  or different.
- *Haploid* : other name for monoploid, only a single set of chromosomes in a cell.
- *Homozygote* : the two alleles are the same.
- *Heterozygote* : the two alleles are different.

### Types of mutations

- *Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP)* : change in the DNA of a nucleotide for another one (e.g.
  replacing a C with a G at a specific position). SNPs also have the constraint to be present in
  more than 1% of the population.
- *Single Nucleotide Variation (SNV)* : same as SNP, without the frequency constraint.
- *Base pair (bp)*: unit of measurement in the genome, counts the number of nucleotides (i.e. a
  deletion of "ACGT" would be a 4bp deletion).
- *Small variations* : variation of a few nucleotides in the DNA, either insertions/deletions of
  less than 10bp (this limit is blury) or SNPs.
- *Copy Number Variation (CNV)* : some portions of the DNA are repeated inside the DNA, the number
  of time they are repeated has a strong influence on the subject.
- *Structural Variation (SV)* : large variations in the DNA, they are either inversions,
  translocations, copy number variations, large insertions/deletions or duplications.
- *Germline mutation* : Mutation that is passed down to the next generation (such as eye color).
- *Somatic mutation* : Mutation that is *not* passed down to the next generation (such as cancer).

### Tools and techniques

- *Variant caller* : Tool used to detect variations in the DNA, either small variations or
  structural variations.
- *Population genomics* : Use of data from other samples from the same population in order to have
  priors in the analysis of a sample.

### Sequencing

- *Read* : sequencer do not work by sequencing the a whole DNA molecule at once, but splits it in
  small sequences called reads.
- *Nx coverage* : Nx coverage means that each part of the genome is expected to have about N reads
  containing it. The coverage thus has a linear relationship with the price of sequencing.
- *reference genome* : sequenced genome used as a ground truth, not necessarily coming from a single
  individual.
- *Alignment* : mapping reads to a reference genome is called alignment.
- *SAM format* : Sequence Alignment Map, file format containing information about aligned reads in
  ASCII. [Li H, Handsaker B, Wysoker A, et al. The Sequence Alignment/Map format and SAMtools.
Bioinformatics. 2009;25(16):2078-2079.
doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btp352.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2723002/)
- *BAM format* : Binary Alignment Map, a compressed SAM file.
- *de novo sequencing* : sequencing of a genome without using a reference genome.
- *Variant Call Format (VCF)* : file format containing information about the variants discovered.

## Small Variation Callers

### Problem statement

Detecting small mutations is still an open problem.

The current method of measurement is precision using a fixed recall, i.e. aiming for 99 precision
with a 90% recall.

The input data is usually aligned reads in BAM format. This can be done because since variations are
small by definition they are thus not too far away from a reference genome and can be properly
aligned.

In SNP discovery competitions the input is usualy FASTA/FASTQ files and the alignment is left to be
done by competitors (usually using Bowtie or BWA[Li H, Handsaker B, Wysoker A, et al. The Sequence Alignment/Map format and SAMtools. Bioinformatics. 2009;25(16):2078-2079. doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btp352.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2723002/)) same as prepocessing (usually GATK, [DePristo MA,
Banks E, Poplin RE, et al. A framework for variation discovery and genotyping using next-generation
DNA sequencing data. Nature genetics. 2011;43(5):491-498.
doi:10.1038/ng.806.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3083463/)).

The output of this task is a VCF file, with the location and types of the variants (indel or SNP).

### Current limitations

The current methods requires a lot of fine tuning by experts for each sample, depending on the
sequencing technology used, the physical sequencing machine used (two Illumina sequencers of the same model will
still require different tunings in variant calling) and the species of the sequenced sample.

This leads to think that the methods are not robust and do not discover invariants in the data.

This also means that getting rid of this tuning process (or at least doing it only once) would be a
great innovation.

Current models also make assumptions that are known to be false about the data, in particular
sequencing errors are assumed to be independent in the model when we know that they are in fact
correlated.

### Available datasets

*Genome In A Bottle consortium*: contains 5 genomes with deep (300x and 100x) coverage sequenced with
12 different technologies, current standard in the domain.   
This dataset is used by the FDA precision medicine challenge.

*1000 genome project*: 1000 genomes with low (4x) coverage with detailed annotations, spearheaded by
the Broad Inistitute.

### Current tools and methods

Most of the current methods use simple statistical models (Naive Bayes + Gaussian Mixtures), the
current gold standard is GATK's HaplotypeCaller described in GATK's best practices.

DeepVariant is a current challenger that scored the best SNP F-score in the FDA precision
challenge (99.9587%) despite performing lower than the other tools in indels.

Here are the results of the top scoring teams (ranked by SNP-Fscore) :

We can see that dgrover-gatk is the best at INDEL F-score and recall while having 'high scores' in
all other categories.   
GATK thus seems to keep its place as the de facto gold standard.

Nevertheless, since many pipelines are using GATK it seems that the art here is to properly
parametrize GATK and to have properly preprocessed the data.

Since DeepVariant seems not to have invested a lot in preprocessing (to their own admission) and
that there focus was on SNP Fscore it stands to reason that there is room for improvements

More details about the results can be found on the [FDA precision
webpage](https://precision.fda.gov/challenges/truth/results).

### Use of Deep Learning

One of the main hurdles in deep learning is finding a representation of the input data that is
suitable for deep learning algorithms (preprocessing), once a representation has been chosen the
type of neural network to use comes easily.

I believe that little work in SNP discovery was done using deep learning because of a lack of such a
representation.


#### DeepVariant

The team lead by Ryan Poplin found such a representation which allowed them to use a convolutional
neural network architecture (Inception V2, which is no longer the state of the art in convolutional
neural networks, Densenet and XNet currently are as of 2017/09).

DeepVariant, leverages Inception, a neural network trained for image
classification by Google Brain, by encoding reads around a candidate SNP as a
221x100 bitmap image, where each column is a nucleotide and each row is a
read from the sample library. The top 5 rows represent the reference, and
the bottom 95 rows represent randomly sampled reads that overlap the
candidate variant. Each RGBA (red/green/blue/alpha) image pixel encodes the
base (A, C, G, T) as a different red value, quality score as a green value,
strand as a blue value, and variation from the reference as the alpha value.

This method has many advantages:

- Takes into account correlation in sequencing errors.
- Is scalable from machine to machine.
- Is scalable from sequencing technology to sequencing technology.
- Is scalable from species to species.
- Achieved best truth score at the 2016 FDA precision challenge.

This method is nevertheless improvable in two ways:

- The representation was an image where data was encoded in the pixel values, which is not the
  closest fit to the data. I believe this was done in order to speed up the process as Google has a
  lot of knowledge in training CNN for image tasks. 
  Using a representation with higher dimension by encoding the inputs as binary classes for each
  nucleotide would make more sense, this approach has been proposed by the original paper and
  confirmed in email exchanges with them.
- Using a better convnet architecture could bring small improvements, even though I don't belive
  this would bring a lot value, as the main task here is in the representation of the data.

DeepVariant is expected to be open sourced in the near future according to the [Google Cloud Engine
webpage](https://cloud.google.com/genomics/v1alpha2/deepvariant).

Doing the proposed improvements has been tried by Jason Chin and is explained in details in
["Simple Convolutional Neural Network for Genomic Variant Calling with TensorFlow"](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/simple-convolution-neural-network-for-genomic-variant-calling-with-tensorflow-c085dbc2026f).
I still believe that his implementation can be improved upon.

#### Campagne's lab

I am mentionning these papers because they were in the "Opportunities..." and come up in google
searches for "SNP calling" and "Deep Learning". Their results did not seem relevant to this review.

### Opportunities

The reason why Deep Learning would be interesting is because it has achieved great performances with
local properties in the field of image recognition.

Work done in DeepBind and DeepMotif also achieved great success in binding sites prediction (DCNN with RELU,
max-pooling and dropout, architecture), which let's us hope that Deep Learning could be a great
tool.

DeepMotif also uses RNNs (just as DeepNano).

- [DeepBind](https://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v33/n8/pdf/nbt.3300.pdf)
- [DeepMotif](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.01133.pdf)
  [followup](https://psb.stanford.edu/psb-online/proceedings/psb17/lanchantin.pdf)

(Both achieve more than state of the art, evein though I do not understand the metrics used).

I belive that deep learning would be an appropriate method here and that there are still improvements
to be done on the work done by Poplin et al..

This could be done by December in the worst case and could be worthy of publication in either
Bioinformatics or a workshop at ICLR (workshop could expend on successes of CNNs in genome analysis).

The advantages would be to :

- Build a working genomic pipeline that could later be reused for Structural variant discovery.
- Get hands on experience with the data at a low cost.
- Be doable quickly because all data is currently freely accessible.
- Get a publishable result within 3 months of the beginning of the PhD.
- Create a working relationship with Ryan's team (headed by Mark DePristo which is head of genomics
  at Google Brain and Verily).
- Gather information on Structural variant discovery.

Having a working architecture for SNP would also help reason about the structure of the data.
Furthermore it would be a good thing to have a unified caller for both SNP and SVs at the end of the
PhD.

## Structural Variant Callers

This problem is much harder and reap for deep learning.

Data is as heterogenous as is possible and will be a challenge to represent in a Deep Learning
friendly way.

models.

### Data sources

Same as with SNP calling.

### Data format

No deep learning or ML has been used (good ol' estimators)

### Possible aproaches

- Ensemble methods pass after the SV callers (voting, stacking, boosting).
- Could be used to select which kind of pipelines to launch (lower computational cost).
- Can be considered an anomaly detection problem (hard CS problem) [see](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031320316300267)
- Work can be done on semi-supervised learning and data augmentation
- Work can be done in order to detect regions of interest and bypasse the local reassembly part or
  at least make it more computationaly efficient. This could be a pre processing step to de novo
  assembly.
- Once SVs have been called, providing an explanation why would be interesting because the
  interpretation phase is not easy for human experts. Potential architecture DBN.
- Providing confidence intervals would be a great progress too.
- Deep Learning on top of contigs graph would be a hard CS problem.
- Interest of Deep Learning: massive amount of data is coming in, Application specific algorithms do
  not take advantage of these except in pre and post processing.

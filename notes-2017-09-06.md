Yesterday's plan was not put in action because of Ikea.

# Deep learning in bioinformatics

Perusing through the papers published in Bioinformatics (Oxford Press) showed that many papers are
published with deep learning mathods (mostly in proteins).

Population genomics uses more standard methods (gaussian mixtures, ensemble methods, naive bayes..).

But it is interesting to note that the journal is open to these methods, even though they are not
used a lot in out area.

# Notes on meeting

for preprocessing:

- samtools
- picard

For library manipulation of data:

- htslib, bcftiiks: C library comes with samtools

Most tasks are IO bounded (which sucks).

Compression factor can be controlled through htslib (for bam)


# Plan for next week

- Familiarize enough with htslib so that I can generate an image (and tensor).
- Finish the exhaustivity proof.
- Investigate ICLR workshop.

# DeepSV

Need to take the memory access into account, this way we can have a single pass in the genome.
This is very significant as IO are a major part of the cost of running NGS analysis.

# samtools

Not yet used to samtools, definitely not optimal it takes multiple minutes per
operation.

##Â split data:

Note: this does not work yet
```
samtools view -b sample.bam chr1 > sample.chr1.bam
```

## sort bam

```
samtools sort <sample.bam> -o out.sorted.bam -@ NTHREAD -n MEM_PER_THREAD
```

# delly

In order to launch delly:

```
delly -g ref.fa <sample_1.bam> <sample_n.bam> -o <output>
```

Can be multithreaded up to the number of files.

# Benchmark everything

TODO: run most of the commands with `time`, delly single-threaded on NA12878 (low coverage) is running.

TODO: see perfs of running `samtools sort` with varying thread numbers

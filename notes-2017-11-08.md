# PINDEL review

## Overview

PINDEL[0] is a structural variant discovery tool that can be used for discovering:

- Deletions in the 1-10kbp range
- Insertions in the 1-10bp range

It is also useful because it can compute breakpoints with high precision.

It is interesting to note that the range of insertions and deletions is probablt higher now, as
PINDEL was designed for short paired end reads (36bp each side).

It uses patern growth as described in a previous paper[1] which can be refered to for the actual
patern growth algorithm.

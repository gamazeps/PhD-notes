I realized that I haven't sent meeting summaries in a while and that I should correct that !

# Topics covered
- Libraries to manipulate SAM/BAM/CRAM data (htslib)
- IO/CPU costs, basically we are mostly bound by IO costs (expensive computations may thus not be a
  bottleneck provided they have a well behaved memory access).
- DeepSV

# DeepSV
We presented the algorithms in DeepSV, in particular DeepSplit and DeepPair.

The other two algorithms were dropped as they could only good for deletions (and they were the most
compute heavy).

We concluded that Paired Reads are good for all types of SV (with poor breakpoint location) and that
Split Reads are good for Insertions, Deletions, Inversions, but rather poor for Duplications and
Translocations.

The idea of creating a tensor that represented the left and right flanking regions of regions of
interest seemed likely to work (and exhaustive).

The drawback of this method is that the pileup images encode a lot of information about the base
pairs, where we would want to encode a lot of information about the reads.
Information about the reads is implicit by having them on the same rows; mapping quality,
orientation and insert size will be encoded in the tensor but this does not feel optimal.

# Plan for next week
Clean up the exhaustivity proof (this work will be needed anyway if we want to publish)
Generate a pileup image, manually, in order to see what it looks like.
This will be done with the htslib library (C), as I am more comfortable with C/C++ than Java.
I also mentioned the idea of attempting to do a workshop at ICLR (the conference is only 5 years
old, but considered A\*) on the topic of representation of sequencing data for pattern recognition.

This is a long shot (call for workshop ends in February), but it might be a good opportunity to get
a foot in the ICML community.

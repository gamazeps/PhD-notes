# Big data analytics class and amazon snafoo

## Class

Well the afternoon was taken by the Big Data Analytics class, the topics were how records were
reprensented in files and pages (in the case of row oriented dbs), how indices work and some basic
introduction to disk access latency (and a super rough introduction to computer architectures).

## Fucking Amazon

I ordered my graphic tablet which was not delivered and the transporter lied about it, it pisses me
off a lot...

I'll try to have stuff delivered to the lab because apparently it works.

Regarding the graphic tablet I'll go and buy one at the Fnac tomorrow night.

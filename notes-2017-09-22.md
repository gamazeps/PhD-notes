# Deep Variant vs Joint Genotyping

A question asked during yesterday's meeting was "Why would deep variant be robust to heteregenous
populations where Joint Genotyping is not".

Indeed, Joint genotyping (calling variants on an individual with ground truths from other
individuals) can have its performance lowered compared to regular genotyping if the ground truth
samples come from another population (sequencing a caucausian with puerto rican ground truth).  
It would make sense that Joint Genotyping uses this population information to establish priors of
the likelihood of variant relative to their position, thus when the joint population comes from a
different genetic island, the priors may not be relevant (some population are lactose intolerent and
some are not).

On the other hand DeepVariant could be more robust because the variant calling step does not take
the location of the candidate into account.
It thus does not have a prior of the likelihood of a mutation at that position, and a fortiori
cannot have bad priors.

# Samples generation

Simple call to samtools takes 0.37s per sample

This takes us `4000*0.37 = 1480s = 24 minutes` per sample which for 2500 samples gives us `42 days`,
if we multithread it on each core of a 40 core machine this should take us a single day.

Thus we shall go with this instead of reimplementating samtools (even though I still want to do that).

# Plan of action

Parse the VCF and generate the regions to target.

The output should be in the form of:

`DeepSV_($SAMPLE)_chr($chr)_($dbvarid)_($type).sam`

We will thus have 16.000.000 files.

Limit ourselves to inversion, dup, del, cnv and generate with `exec` with 40 threads.

# What was done

The parsing is done.

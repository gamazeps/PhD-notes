# Merging SV callers

The phase 3 1000GP SV group created a database with ~68k SVs with about 50% of them
unknown until then.

My idea of charaterizing SV callers based on their callsets and overlaps was somehow done in their
supplementary material.

They explained how they used each of the most common SV callers and plotted their overlap, it is
interesting to see that MEI and NUMT (dynumt) were only caught by a single caller each.

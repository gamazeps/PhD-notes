# I did it, a new note !

Today is a bright new day, I even managed to get up at a decent hour without being dead tired; I
have trust in this week.

I bought a wacom in order to get rid of the slide making, it maight even work.

I spend a good part of Sunday going back and forth on the Homework, and it was a pain, it was just
easy and long as hell. At least if it were hard or new it may have been fun, but it was not...


## Plan for the day

Some paper reading is in order, it's been a while since I last did that !

The plan is for reading:

- [GESALL 2017 paper](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~aroy/gesall-sigmod17.pdf)
- [Multiple Object Recognition with Visual Attention](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.7755.pdf)

### Notes on GESALL

The paper was a bit longer than planned so I didn't have time to fully understand it.

The main problem that it seems to solve is the access pattern of data, that is having files that
make sense once split in hadoop blocks (BAM is special) and make sure that both ends of a read are
on the same block (logical partition).

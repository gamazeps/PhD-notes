Well lots of notes disapeared once again...

Silly idea for deepSV: including the number of std for the insert size is probably useless because
the window size is already big enough to imnply that if a split happens, the insert is ridiculously
big.

Also, we can include data from other technologies, to see if we can predict them with short read
technologies.

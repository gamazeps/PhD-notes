Dear all,

Every year every Inria team needs to write an activity report.
For instance, our 2016 activity report is
https://raweb.inria.fr/rapportsactivite/RA2016/cedar/cedar.pdf

Michaël has kindly started the report for this year.
Its current stage (___very___ preliminary :) is attached.

===> We need to have it ready by Jan 5, 2018!

I will solicit you until then to ask for more content for the report.
In a nutshell:

a. each member's scientific activity for the year needs to be
reflected in (at least) one 5-to-15 lines paragraph under "new
results" (Section 7).
If there are more projects, there should be more such short descriptions.

Of course, each project is described only once (not once per project member).

I will solicit you individually for the pieces that are missing.

b. all the publications *of 2017* are already in principle in; if you
see anything missing, you need to declare it into hal.inria.fr and we
will pick it up automatically from there;

c. it would be good to mention new software prototypes developed into
the team; if you are working on one, you need to declare it into
Inria's BIL software base; ask me how to do that.

d. we will add more program committee memberships, editorial
responsibilities and such other "senior" items. If there is anything
you did which appears missing, let me know!

Thank you for your help in this important yearly task!

Best regards,

Ioana

Dear Yanlei and colleagues:

I am coming back with a more detailed request.

I need contributions from you in the following categories:

=========
Section 3, Research Program ("what we are working on")
=========
We need a subsection for each "area" of the team research.

In this version taken from 2016, for all of Yanlei's research there is only:

3.4. Interactive Data Exploration at Scale
In the Big Data era we are faced with an increasing gap between the
fast growth of data and the
limited human ability to comprehend data. Consequently, there has been
a growing demand of data
management tools that can bridge this gap and help users retrieve
high-value content from data more
effectively. To respond to such user information needs, we aim to
build interactive data exploration as a
new database service, using an approach called “explore-by-example”.

- Maybe you want to revisit it?

- Please do not hesitate to add such subsections so that *the research
of each team member is reflected!*

==========
Section 4, Application Domains *if you want to add/edit, feel welcome*!
==========

==========
Section 5, Highlights of the year:
@Yanlei, I think we should mention the start of your ERC - did it
start in 2017? (I think so?)
==========

==========
Section 6, New software:
It would be good to register software prototypes you have developed as
part of your research, into BIL
(bil.inria.fr). This does not take any IP away, it just allows us to
get some visibility and credit for the development work.
==========

==========
Section 7, New results:
Here we need a subsection for each area in which there is a
publication, including an MS report, if that is what we have.
So basically for each research topic, the motivation and broad program
go in Section 3,
and a description of what has been achieved this year on the topic, go
in Section 7.
==========

Please organize among co-authors so that someone will give me input
for each topic, and let me know who that person is.
The deadline is quite soon (I'd like to have all the inputs by
Thursday if possible so that I can integrate them on Fri).

Thank you for contributing to this important task for the Inria team!

@Yanlei: I'll take care of our joint work with Shu.

Thanks and best,

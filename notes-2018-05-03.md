# Deepvariant

They use the `nets` module from tensorflow slim API

# Profiling

We can use `ProfilerHook` for having a profile of the operations.

The tracing uses [chrome's tracer](https://github.com/catapult-project/catapult/blob/master/tracing/README.md)

However I do not know if it can be used for profiling IOs

More info on tf profiling in specifics can be found [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/core/profiler)

# Implementation choice

Take a coded model from `tf.contib.slim.nets` and launch it on our data.

Check how this can be put on distributed tensorflow and behaviour with `ProfilerHook` and compare
operation time, if needed: add a bunch of convolution or sparse convolutions (from basset)

# Meeting stuff

Time spent reviewing various APIs of tensorflow, choiuce goes for tensorflow slim, provodes already
written models.

Provides hooks for profiling

Understood how to write models on dummy data

Need to ingest my data into these models, the issue is that this is its whole framework and data
which requires a fair amount of reading and toying with...

The learning curve is a bit harsh

# Experiment

Today was an experiment on day with no computer.

The idea was pretty good and I will continue the experiment on Tuesdays for a month or two I hope.

# Social stuffs

I was a bit tired and we had some social meetings that day since everybody was back from holidays
and we did a "Galette des rois", so I did not do much.

# Machine Learning A Probabilistic Perspective

I worked through "3. Proability" which was 30 pages long, it took me *wayyyyyy* longer than
expected, that is about 3+ hours but I hope that this is because I am extremely rusty in maths and
proofs.

It gave me a good review on how to do computations and basic probability concepts, plus an
interesting view on Kullback-Leibler divergence as an information theory distance (number of bits to
encode the difference between two functions), as well as introducing the mutual information
criteria. 

The concepts in the book will probably not be directly applicable in the PhD as they are mostly
about Good Ol' Machine Learning, but I believe that they will help be build strong fundations.

# Unrelated reading

As I'm not used to having no computers I took breaks by reading "Sapiens", and I read a bit more
than expected so it took me a fair amount of time.

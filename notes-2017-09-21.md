Hello starnger it's been a while since my last note !

# Genomics and personalized medicine: what everybody should know

This book was recommended by Allen Guo when we met him last week, I am only 50 pages in and it is
currently deeply interesting.

It provides a very practical introduction on how genomics have been used for précision medicine (in
the first 4 chapters) and its practical effects.

# Literature review

My litterature review on variant callers did not progress a lot this week, as I spend a lot of time
working on the deep variant presentation.

Indeed I discovered the Supplementary materials last Friday, and it contains information on most of
the questions I was asking myself about the used methods.

Note to self: it is odd that this is not what was published instead of the actual paper, it feels
much more precise and interesting, I may need some time to understand that the "How" is not always
the most important point in research.

# Deep nano

Paper recently published that used RNNs for base calling on MinION.

They used a 3 layers (with 250 hidden units) gated RNN that worked on the fast5 sequence data
outputed by the sequencer.

The sequencer uses a propriétary base caller called Metrichor, which is based on HMMs (6 previous
steps) and an application of Viterbi afterwards. It was thus reasonable to expect success of RNNs
based methods as they were equaly successful in speach processing tasks (which used the same
algorithms).

## Viterbi reminder

Input:
- a set of states with probablibities (genrated with HMM)
- a set of transition probabilities

Output: succession of states that create the traversal with the highest likelyhood.

Method: Dynamic programming for finding the most likely path to each state.
    

# Data sourcing project

The technical debts in machine learning systems paper gave me the idea of a data sourcing solution
that is developped in greater details in `data-sourcing-project.md`.

The main steps of the projects are provided, but the litterature review is still to be done there, I
was advised to look into the "workflow extraction" domain.

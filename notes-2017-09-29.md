# A poor week

Well it's been a while since the last note...

This week was mostly spend on solidifying my understanding of the fundations of machine learning
(thanks a lot to karpathy's cs231n).

I also finished the first module of andrew ng's coursera specialization (didn't learn much though, I
hope the others will be interesting).

# A half decent day

I managed to focus a little despite being pretty tired for this whole week...

A decent part of today's was spend on trying to implement a CNN from scratch using numpy and I was
slow as hell !

Trying to implement it naively (for a simple conv-pool-conv-pool-fc-fc) is pretty harder than
expected, mostly because of having to massage the data around (pooling is ugly to implement and
padding makes a f$$kton of variables and matrices...).

I'll probably implement it in a modular way even though it will be a tiny bit harder on my brains
but faster to implement in the end.

# RNNs

I tried to freshen up on RNNs by re reading karpathy's stuff.

# Plan for next week

Working without a pomodoro was stupid this week, I'll fix that and start to be stupidly organised
again (and not fuck with my sleep).

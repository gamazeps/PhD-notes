Well there is a lot of stuff to rewind here, I'll do it at some point...

# SINE - LINE

Taken from wiki, but extremely commonly mentionned in the litterature.

## SINE

Short Interspersed Nuclear Elements: non-autonomous, non-coding transposable elements (TEs) that are
50-500 base pairs long.

## LINE

Long interspersed nuclear element: group of non-LTR (long terminal repeat) retrotransposons which
are widespread in the genome of many eukaryotes. They make up around 21.1% of the human
genome.

Retrotransposons also called transposons via RNA intermediate are genetic elements that can amplify
themselves in a genome and are ubiquitous components of the DNA of many eukaryotic organisms. These
DNA sequences use a "copy-and-paste" mechanism, whereby they are first transcribed into RNA, then
converted back into identical DNA sequences using reverse transcription, and these sequences are
then inserted into the genome at target sites.
Retrotransposons form one of the two subclasses of transposons, where the others are DNA
transposons, which does not involve an RNA intermediate.

## Discussion

These are mobile elements that are common all throughout the genome (up to 20% for LINE), their
mobility makes them a balanced SV, the clinical importance of their location should be investigated
to know whether we can discard them or not (indeed, not discarding them makes the problem much
harder as they are extremely common, and thus not exactly an anomaly).

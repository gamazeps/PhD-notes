## Too many rows

Currently my implementation has too many rows (about 150), this is the same as DeepVariant, but
our rows are 20 times longer than theirs.

A solution would be to put multiple reads on a single row, however this presents the issue that
it may become hard to identify which read belongs to which pair.

# Encoding direction

Instead of adding a channel for the read direction, we could put a sign to the bases.

i.e. an `A` would be encoded as `[1, 0, 0, 0]` on a read in the forward direction and would
be encoded as `[-1, 0, 0, 0]` on the backward direction.

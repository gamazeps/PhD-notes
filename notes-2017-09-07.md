## Structural Variations callers

### Reviews

[Lin K., Smit S., Bonnema G., Sanchez-Perez G., de Ridder D. (2014). Making the difference: integrating structural variation detection tools. Brief. Bioinform. 10.1093/bib/bbu047 ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25504367)

Great review of structural variations

[Detection of Genomic Structural Variants from Next-Generation Sequencing Data](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4479793/)

Other review of SV callers. Broader and with more explanations, but does not go into ensemble
models.

### Tools

[Chen, X. et al. (2016) Manta: rapid detection of structural variants and indels for germline and cancer sequencing applications. Bioinformatics, 32, 1220-1222. doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btv710](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/bioinformatics/btv710)

Manta overview, just presents the results and says that they are cool.
Uses contig graph, then some stats on that data (to be developped).

and medium sized insertions from paired-end short reads. Bioinformatics , 25,
2865–2871.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19561018)

split-read analysis. Bioinformatics , 28, i333–i339.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22962449)

## SNV callers

# Germline vs Somatic mutations

[Germline Mutations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germline_mutation) are mutations that are transmitted to their offspring.

[Somatic Mutations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_(biology)) are mutations that are *not*
transmitted to their offsprings, Cancer mutations are a case of Somatic mutations.

The heightened interest in germline mutations makes sense since they are thus more common across
individuals which allows for better reference datasets.

Somatic mutations also have the property to be spontaneous throughout the life of the organism,
which makes them harder to catch. They can apparently be more frequent than germline ones (see [Walter
CA, Intano GW, McCarrey JR, McMahan CA, Walter RB (1998). "Mutation frequency declines during
spermatogenesis in young mice but increases in old mice". Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 95 (17):
10015–9. PMC 21453 Freely accessible. PMID 9707592](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC21453/)).


# copy number variation

same nucleotides repeated in a place.
Huge clinical impact (huntington)
Some loci are more susceptibles.

A network could learn patterns in its kernels ank learn how to count ( convnets are good )

non ml: entropy might be a cool approach (i.e compressability).

# TODO:

- Read PinDel and DELLY, and technical suplemet for Manta
- Summarize
[(Lin et al., 2015) Making the difference: integrating structural variation detection tools. Brief Bioinform.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25504367)
and explain the data sources and problems.
- Write a proposal for the data depency graph with SLAs
- Write proposal for PhD project
  - Problem statement
    - Biological presentation
    - Data sources
    - Need for callers 
    - Current state of callers
  - Current callers
    - SNVs
    - SVs: poorly done ensemble methods
  - Future work
    - Importance of representations
    - Better representation for SNVs
    - Proper ensemble model for SVs
    - Single model integretaing different data sources and outputs.

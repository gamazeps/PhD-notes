# Long time no C

Well once again I failed to take notes on a regular basis...

Last week was lost to ICDE...


## Benchmark time to get reads from disk

## Profiling

Looking at perf, profile, Cprofile and other profilers tools showed little
to no interest in our use case as they mesure time spent in a function, which
is useless since the part we want to profile is monothreaded whereas the rest
is multithreaded.

We are however lucky because TensorFlow provides a profiler to us.

## Next task

Tensorflow here we go !

But first up, quickly check how deepVariant does its training

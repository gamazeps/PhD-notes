This meeting was done with only Pr. Diao and FÃ©lix.

# Topics Covered

DeepSV representation and limitations:

- Representation captures all information in a single window.
- Representation is poor for variants that affect multiples regions (i.e. interspersed duplications
  and translocations).
- Proof of exhaustivity.

As a reminder the representation is a window of bounded size (`4*(insert + read size)` or `4*Insert
+ 6*Read` if we integrate split reads), this allows to catch variants of all sizes with a single
  model.

There was a disagreement on the major contribution of this method:

- In Pr. Diao's opinion, the fact the the signals from Read Count, Paired Reads, and Split Reads
  were united in a single representation and used together (instead of one after the other in other
  methods) is the main contribution as it would allow a better statistical analysis.
- In Felix's opinion, the simple fact of presenting the problem as a pattern recognition one, is the
  main reason why we hope better results. It is noteworthy that this is not because of a smarter
  analysis, but because deep learning is known for tremendously improving statistical power in most
  areas of science.

# Work for next meeting

We agreed that the task for next week was:

- Write a detailed pseudo-code for the candidate emission phase.
- Write a detailed pseudo-code for the training and prediction phases.
- Prepare a *nice* presentation of the whole algorithms from start to end (i.e. FASTQ -> VCF).

# Ideas mentionned

I mentionned the idea of attempting to publish this as a workshop for ICLR, after better
consideration I believe that the contributions could be presented as an ML paper at ICML (cfp ends
February 8th).

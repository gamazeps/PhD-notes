# Introductory slides for DeepSV

Stuffs...

# Marcus paper

He basicaly goes on to say that deep learning is a nice statistical tool for correlations and only
working on data from the same distribution, which almost everyone in the community agrees on (the
main difference is in whether DL could be improved to handle knowledge and logical reasoning).

He nevertheless mentions unsupervised learning which makes me think that it may be interesting to
see if the enriched pileup image, or even just a pileup image could be clustered with unsupervised
learning (showing that it encodes enough information).

# ICML

Looked up if there is a spot for our paper at ICML, seems a bit tricky as this conference seems very
theoretical. There are nevertheless a venue for "Aplications" and "Healthcare" which we could try,
but I am not so confident anymore.

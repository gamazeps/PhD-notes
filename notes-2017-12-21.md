Assembly based SV caller, works best on variant form 50bp to 300bp.

Manages to catch sites of viral infections and template sequence insertions (though no idea what
they are in reality).

They mention: International Cancer Genome Consortium, which may be an interesting source of data.

The algorithm (overly simplified) is:

- identify regions of interest based on discordant read pairs
- Generate a window in that area and assemble there (using SGA).
- Map the new contig to the genome with BWA and much smaller penalty for opening and closing an
  insert/delete window.
- Try to map all the reads to either the new contig or the reference
- If more support for the new contig, consider it the truth.

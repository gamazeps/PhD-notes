Note: today will no be extremely efficient as I had a few too many drinks yesterday.

# DeepSV preprocessing architecture

I am currently implementing the preprocessing of DeepSV, here is the architecture and implementation
plan in my mind

## VCF manipulation

Written in rust with an ugly parser (`split('\t')` followed by an indexing) and a minimal
implementation of the CVF format limited to the flags appearing in the dbvar data.

## BAM manipulation

At first my plan was to call an `exec("samtools -b {} {}")` and be done with it, but it does seem
rather ugly and not necessarily efficient.

My current plan is to call `htslib` via either [rust-bio](https://github.com/rust-bio/rust-htslib)
or [rust-htslib](https://github.com/rust-bio/rust-htslib), I'll probably settle on `rust-htslib`
even though the types may be a pain to manipulate.

## File access

I will need to implement a way to access variants by sample so that I can avoid fetching the files
for each variants.

In my opinion the best policy will be to access sample by sample, with increasing coordinates so
that I have the best memory access pattern, with reads to fetch written as messages on a FIFO and a
single file open at the same time (if that is possible, otherwise one thread per individual as I
have enough RAM for it in low coverage data).

TODO: check how htslib manages conccurent accesses to a file (in read-only mode).

*anwer*: it is shitty as fuck... Not even worth trying to save.

We'll have to rewrite it from scratch.

# GATK v4

The Broad Institute released GATK v4 2018/01/09, it's full of features that seem pretty amazing
(writeup to come soon) mostly in the area of distribution and datastorage.

They are hinting at investigating deep learning for replacing VQSR right after the variant calling
step, which is a bit different than our approach (which reduces the role of the caller at a
minimum). But it is noteworthy that they are working on DeepLearning for CNV detection which is
precisely our project.

(also developped on 2018-01-12 note).

# Paper

Avinash seemed to agree with my aproach of reducing the scope for a machine learning paper and then
do a full bioinfo paper.

The evaluation strategy was also deemed acceptable.
